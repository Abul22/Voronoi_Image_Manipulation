## Requirements:

- Graphics card supporting OpenGL 3.3

### Windows:

- Have mingw64 installed. Other C compilers might or might not work. Please report back if it works or submit necessary changes to this README.

## Run:

- run ```go get ./...``` to install all dependencies
- run ```go build``` within the projects directory
- make sure, there exists a directory called _Images_ with the file _apple.png_ inside (Is loaded as default). The image is delivered with the project. So everything works by default.
